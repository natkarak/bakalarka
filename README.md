This is code for the practical part of my Bachelor's thesis.

The topic of my thesis: Assignment of pecuniary contributions to compensate for severe disablement - development of a web application and analysis of the current situation and laws

I chose this topic because I saw a lot of potential in improving the accessibility of information in this area. For my thesis, I created a demo version of the application mainly as a proof of concept after analyzing the current situation and laws regarding the compensations for disablement.
